3. Email this page (by Google) by Google

Jacopo's extension and the Google extensions each have different feature sets, but I want all in one extension. So I'm combining them to add all the funtionality into a single extension.

I'm also intrested in adding features.

So far, I've added the ability to hard code one or more email addresses to send a page to.

Problems: BUTTON DOES NOT WORK

Future changes:
Will get a better icon (right now using the Share Icon: http://shareicons.com)
Will make button work
Will add option to turn off button
Will clean up code
